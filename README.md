## Description
This is a MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.<br>
It uses React for the front end, along with GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.<br>
It uses MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.  It uses queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.<br>
It has been deployed using Heroku (with data) and has a retro, custom UI designed to look like an old video game.<br>
It is responsive and interactive (i.e., accepts and responds to user input) and includes JWT authentication.<br>
It protects sensitive API key information on the server.<br>
It has a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).<br>
It has a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).<br>
